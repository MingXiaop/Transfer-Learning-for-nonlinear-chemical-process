- The First Principle equation for this system are as follows:
- $$\frac{dC_A}{dt} = \frac{F}{V} (C_{A0} - C_A) - k_0 e^{-\frac{E}{RT}} C_A^2$$
- $$\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{F}{V} (T_0 - T) + \frac{-\Delta H}{\rho_L C_P} k_0 e^{-\frac{E}{RT}} C_A^2 + \frac{Q}{\rho_L C_P V} $$

- Where,

   - 𝐶_𝐴: Concentration of reactant A (kmol/m3)
   - 𝑇: Temperature of the reactor (K)
   - 𝐶_𝐴0: Concentration of reactant A in the feed
   - 𝑄 :  Heat input rate (kJ/h)
   - F: feed volumetric flow rate (m3/h)
   - 𝑇0: Inlet temperature (K)


- The State and Manipulated variable for this system is:

    - States variables: 𝐱=[𝐶_𝐴−𝐶_𝐴𝑠, 𝑇 −𝑇_𝑠 ]
    - Control / Manipulated variables: 𝐮=[𝐶_𝐴0−𝐶_𝐴0𝑠, 𝑄 −𝑄_𝑠 ]


- The generated dataset with the input and output will look like:

- The ODE is explicitly embedded in the loss function and is calculated based on the RNN predicted states, where the derivative (LHS) is approximated using the finite difference method.
- The RHS of the ODE is computed by substituting the PIRNN predicted states and the manipulated inputs into the first principle equation.
- The physics informed loss is the error between the LHS and RHS of the ODE using the PIRNN predicted results and is incorporated during model training. 

## 4. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Structure

- RNN are a class of neural networks that is powerful for modeling sequence data such as time series data.
- It can handle sequential data and account for past information in the current prediction.

- The RNN model input and output are as follows:
    - Input: System initial state variable 𝐱_𝟎(𝑡_𝑘), and control variables 𝐮(𝑡_𝑘).
    - Output: Future state dynamics 𝐱(𝑡_𝑘+Δ) are predicted for one sampling period ∆.
